# Prediction-using-Supervised-ML
Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data.The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.
The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y).
It is a model used to predict the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours. 
This is a simple linear regression model as it involves just 2 variables.
